 3 types
 1. Division Method
 2. Folding Method
 3. Mid Square Method


 1.Division Method ----: When the array size is limited we store the data by using modulo of a number
                        (ex: 128%10 = 8 & 28%10 = 8) so in both case we can store it in arr[8]
    a. Collision : while stori ng there can be multiple numbers coming for same index that is called collision
    b. Chaining : to avoid that we use chaining by using linkedlist,
                   so basically we chain the data in a sorted order
                   (ex: arr[8] : 18--> 28 --> 38 --> 138 this is how chaining using linkedlist works)
        If the collision happens a lot and all the numbers falls under only 1 index then it will be
        worst case amd takes O(n)

        storing
                    o(1) best and average case & o(n) in worst case
        fetching
